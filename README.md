# percentageCPP
Basic percentage calculator written in C++ via CodeBlocks

After making the first percentage calculator in python, I decided to give it a go in C++
to see how it would turn out. 

Still haven't figured out how to create my function and call it properly,
hence why main() is called in the if statements to start it over after if 
user input is 'y' or 'Y'.
